        <p>With a passion for exploring new horizons, indulging in heavy music, and embracing continuous learning, I find joy in the simplest pleasures: basking in the sun at the beach with a BBQ (it's the Aussie in me!), long gaming sessions, and, in the past year, delving into the world of programming. These experiences fuel my drive and commitment to excel. As you uncover more about me, you'll discover my unapologetic love for ducks. Together, let's collaborate and innovate.</p>

        <p>I embarked on a coding journey when I discovered that programming was being taught to kids in primary schoolâ€”I didn't want to be left behind. After an 11-year career in retail, I yearned for a new passion, and it was during those nights when thoughts of writing blocks of code consumed me that I realized I had found it. Today, I am thrilled to bring my unwavering enthusiasm and commitment to organizations that appreciate individuals driven by their passions. If you're seeking someone who shows up every day eager to explore and create, I look forward to collaborating with you.</p>
